                <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt, plus a variety of ingredients, 
                    such as vegetables, and any meat, but most commonly seafood (often raw but can be cooked).
                    It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce.</p>

                            <h3>Maki</h3>
                            <p>Maki sushi is made by layering the nori seaweed with rice and fillings on top, then firmly roll everything into a tube and slice it into bite-sized pieces.
                                All sushi rolls that are wrapped in seaweed with fillings on the inside are considered maki sushi.</p>

                            <p>Nigiri is made using a pillow of rice with a topping of a sliced raw or cooked seafood delicately placed on top. 
                                The difference between nigiri and maki is that the rice in nigiri is pressed into a bite-sized mound, while maki sushi is rolled 
                                and then sliced into small rolls.</p>

                            <p>Uramaki sushi is a rolled sushi with rice on the outside and nori seaweed on the inside. 
                                This is not a traditional shushi, it was created in Los Angeles by a sushi chef who wanted to appeal to American customers, 
                                so he hid the seaweed on the inside. 
                                It's common for uramaki to be sprinkled with sesame seeds that cling to the sticky rice. </p>

                            <p>Temaki sushi hand roll consists of a large seaweed cone stuffed with rice, fish, and other sushi fillings. 
                                Unlike maki rolls, temaki is not firmly rolled with the method that produces uniform pieces of sushi and it is not sliced in small pieces.
